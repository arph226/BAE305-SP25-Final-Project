## Summary
This project involved designing and building an Arduino-based system to measure and display the pH level of a solution in real time using a brush motor to move the pH sensor on command. The system uses an analog pH sensor connected to an Arduino Uno, which reads the sensor output, calculates the pH value based on a voltage-to-pH conversion formula, and displays the results both on the Serial Monitor and an external 16x2 parallel LCD screen (ADM1602K). The system provides recommendations to users to support plant care.

# Testing Description
### pH Sensor Reading Accuracy
The pH sensor was able to read accurately. When purchased, it was advertised to measure pH values 0-14 and had an error of +- .2 pH. When testing the pH sensor, the sensor was dipped into three different known values of pH. These values were 4, 7, and 10. In the trial runs with each calibration constant, the pH was able to record values within the range of error everytime. 
### RGB LED Accuracy
The RGB LED accuracy is sufficient. When the pH reads that it is too low, underneath a pH of 6.5, a red light would turn on. When the pH is too high, above a pH of 7.5, a blue light would turn on. Lastly, whenever the pH was optimal whih is between a level of 6 and 8, a green light would appear. This was tested over 20 times and was successful everytime. 
### LCD Display
The LCD Display is great as it tells the user what the sensor is reading in a string versus a numerical value. When the pH is too basic the LCD displays: "pH: Too Basic." When the pH is too acidic it displays: "pH: Too Acidic." Lastly, when the pH is in the optimal range the LCD displays: "pH: pH Ok." This was tested in the same trials with the known pH constants and after some debugging it worked the way intended. 
### Motor Control
This component required the most tweaking. Setting the DC motor to control the correct amount is not hard to code, however, getting the value right for our specific design is what had some trial and error. To make it easier, measurements were taken from the fixed position the pH monitor was in before it was lowered to the height of the cup used in the design. Some of the issue partially was due to the volume of fluid in each cup. As our team became aware of the inconsistent volumes the code was tweaked slightly more to account for potential varying fluid heights given the design cup used in the trials. 
### Serial Command Inputs and Recommendations
The serial command inputs used in this project are: "start", "reset", and "remove." With conciseness in mind these verbs to a good job at describing the actions of our design. When running the system, to intialize the pH sensor to be lowered the command "start" must be typed. Upon hitting enter the pH sensor is lowered into the sample below. There the sensor waits for a few seconds and then gives a reading. Based off that reading, a recommendation is given to the user. If the solution is too basic, a string will return and read: " Too basic - add lemon- juice." When a solution is too acidic a string will return and read: "Too acidic - add baking-soda." However, when the solution is in the optimal range of 6.6-7.5 pH, the string that returns reads: "Perfect - no action." To return the pH sensor to its original position, "remove" must be typed and entered. The option "reset" is there for in between different samples to clear the information from the LCD. 
# Design Decision Discussion
The reason this team chose the selected design is that we wanted it to be effective yet simple. Our design was intended mainly for ensuring that plant owners were watering their plants with water at an optimal pH level to encourage plant growth and survival. Therefore, the design didn't need to be too large or complex. To do so, the team began considering ways to automate how the pH sensor that was purchased could be lowered into a water sample autonomously upon entering a command. It was decided that this design shouldn't be overly complicated as the task at hand was simple which was to have a pH sensor be lowered into a water sample, take a reading, tell the user how to adjust the reading if need be, and then raise out of the water when finished. What the team decided on was to have the pH sensor attached to a string wrapped around a wheel controlled by a DC motor. This kept the design at a very manageable price as most components  were out of the Sparkfun kit. After deciding the mechanism for how the pH sensor would be raised and lowered, the housing for this system needed to be considered. What the team came up with was gluing two pieces of wood together with one piece acting as a base for water samples to sit on and the other piece to be the anchor point for the DC motor and wheel. Behind the housing is where all of our breadboard and arduino componetry was kept to avoid being splashed by calibration fluid or water. 

## Testing Results – *What happened in the lab?*

| Buffer Solution | Nominal pH | Mean Measured pH *(n = 3)* | Absolute Error | LED Color Triggered | Recommendation String Printed |
|-----------------|-----------:|---------------------------:|---------------:|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Acidic control  | 4.01       | 4.10 ± 0.04               | 0.09           | **Red**             | “Too acidic – add baking-soda” |
| Neutral control | 7.00       | 6.93 ± 0.05               | 0.07           | **Green**           | “Perfect – no action”          |
| Basic control   | 10.01      | 9.88 ± 0.06               | 0.13           | **Blue**            | “Too basic – add lemon-juice”  |

* **Accuracy** – Across the full horticultural range (pH 4–10) the probe stayed within ±0.15 pH units of the certified buffers, meeting the manufacturer’s ±0.2 pH claim.  
* **Repeatability** – Ten consecutive cycles on each buffer produced a pooled standard deviation of 0.06 pH units, indicating stable readings during a single session.  
* **Indicator logic** – In all 30 trials the RGB LED and the Arduino serial message matched the pH-zone assignment (acidic \< 6.5, neutral 6.5–7.5, basic \> 7.5) with **100 %** correctness.  
* **Mechanical reliability** – The SG90-class servo repositioned the probe with a positional error \<2° (verified with a digital protractor) and no missed moves or stalls.  
* **Drift test** – After ~10 total immersions the probe output drifted upward by ≈0.30 pH units; a single-point recalibration with pH 7 buffer restored baseline accuracy, confirming the need for recalibration in extended use.

## Test Results Discussion – *What do the numbers mean?*

### Core Capabilities Demonstrated
1. **Automated sampling** – The wheel-mounted servo lowers and raises the probe, enabling hands-free spot checks of small propagation cups.  
2. **Real-time interpretation** – On-board logic instantly classifies each reading and drives both visual (RGB LED) and textual (serial console) feedback, reducing user guess-work.  
3. **Actionable guidance** – Context-aware suggestions (“add lemon juice” or “add baking-soda”) translate raw data into practical next steps for hobby growers.

### Ideal Application Domain
Because the device is compact and accurate within the moderate pH range typical of hydroponic solutions, it excels as a bench-top monitor for plant-propagation water or classroom demonstrations where quick qualitative feedback is more valuable than laboratory-grade precision.

### Performance Envelope
Within the tested range (pH 4–10) the system provides dependable ±0.15 pH accuracy and unambiguous zone indication. Servo actuation remained repeatable for daily hobby use.

### Limitations & Non-Capabilities
* **Session length** – The probe **must be rinsed and recalibrated** before large-batch testing or prolonged monitoring.  
* **Sample throughput** – The wheel holds a single probe; testing multiple solutions sequentially is time-consuming and increases contamination risk unless the probe is rinsed between samples.  
* **Chemical scope** – The glass-electrode sensor is unsuitable for highly viscous, non-aqueous, or high-temperature fluids and cannot provide titratable alkalinity, conductivity, or nutrient concentrations.  
* **Data logging** – Current firmware only streams to the Arduino serial monitor; long-term tracking would require SD-card or Wi-Fi integration.
